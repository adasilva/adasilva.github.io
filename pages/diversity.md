Physics is one of the fields which remains male-dominated, despite the fact that women make up roughly half of all high school physics classes. The reason [women don't complete physics bachelors degrees](https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201511/backpage.cfm) at the same rate as men are sometimes subtle, and [no one solution](https://journals.aps.org/prper/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevSTPER.9.020115) will fix the problem. The American Institute of Physics has [reports on women in physics]("http://www.aip.org/statistics/women") in which you can dig deeper into the data.

I am particularly interested in how [peer networks](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2128384) can foster a sense of belonging, improving the recruitment and retention of members of underrepresented groups. As a graduate student at Penn State, I was one of the founders of the Physics and Astronomy for Women group, which has the goal of getting the women in the department together to form a support network. On the APS [committee on the status of women in physics](http://www.aps.org/about/governance/committees/cswp/index.cfm), I worked on a [grant program](https://www.aps.org/programs/women/scholarships/wipgrants.cfm) to provide financial support to both new and existing women in physics groups at colleges universities. You can read an editorial I wrote on the benefits of women in physics groups for the [Spring 2016 issue of the CSWP & COM Gazette](https://www.aps.org/programs/women/reports/gazette/upload/spr16.pdf).
