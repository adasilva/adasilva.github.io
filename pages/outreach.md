I have experience communicating science to technical and non-technical audiences.

As the outreach coordinator at McGill University, I led a team of volunteers in hosting teacher workshops, school groups, and public lectures. I also led teams in developing new science activities, and delivering activities at summer camps and in schools.

More information will be coming soon.
