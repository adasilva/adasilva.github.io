I am a physicist, programmer, and consultant with expertise in condensed matter physics, scientific programming in python, data analysis and machine learning, diversity in science, and scientific communication and outreach.

I am available for new consulting projects, both technical and education-related. My technical expertise includes nanotechnology, graphene, electronic and optical properties, computational modeling, data analysis, and machine learning. In my previous work, I have developed excellent skills in communication of technical subject matter to both technical and non-technical audiences, as well as experience in planning, organizing, and executing complex projects.

Samples of my physics research can be found on my [research page]({{ 'research' | relative_url }}). Some other technical projects can be found on my [github page](http://www.github.com/adasilva) Information about other projects that I have worked on will be available soon.


## Education and awards

I received my PhD in physics from Penn State University in 2012. At Penn State I was a member of the [Center for Nanoscale Science](https://www.mrsec.psu.edu/), an interdiciplinary research project focused on understanding nanoscale materials. I received several honors for my work, including the [The Alumni Association Dissertation Award](http://www.gradschool.psu.edu/graduate-funding/fellowships/programs/aada/previous-alumni-association-disseration-award-winners-2002-2007/2008-2013-alumni-association-dissertation-award-winners/) for my thesis research on the electronic transport properties of graphene and topological insulators and the Peter Eklund Memorial Lectureship from the physics department, given to graduate students for excellence in research and presentation skills. In 2011 I visited Peking University in Beijing as a Fellow in the National Science Foundation's [East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5284). After graduating from Penn State, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Texas Austin from 2012 - 2016. There my work focused on graphene, a single layer of graphite, which has unique electronic properties, and is being considered in applications ranging from computer chips to touch screens.
