Properties of materials are derived from the properties of their consituent electrons, protons, and neutrons. In my training as a theoretical condensed matter physicist, I modeled macroscopic properties by starting from the basic building blocks of electrons and the nuclei to which they are bound. The properties that I investigated are fundamental to modern technological applications. For example cell phone antennas require conversion between electronic motion and electromagnetic radiation and computer chips are increasingly dependent on a quantum mechanical description of electronic properties.
